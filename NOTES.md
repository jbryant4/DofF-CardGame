### Game functionality
Instead of thinking of moves like draw resurrect and discard. It should be  move function that is moving a card from states and in that function can be the checks for certain card states. ex block would cause the card to not move and that could be the key number pair where the number represents how many turns that stand for 

Should make new type gameCard that takes the combat stats/effects from card document but also have the states that need to be manipulated in the game.
